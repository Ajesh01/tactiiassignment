This is my completed Assignment given to me in round 2.
This is a flask app which restricts articles after certain views.

- If the user isn't logged in, then he/she can use up the "number of free articles" and still revisit said articles.

-If the user is logged in, the user can use up the "number of free articles" and revisit said articles on multiple/different devices since the details of the "free articles" they read, are stored on a DB.
